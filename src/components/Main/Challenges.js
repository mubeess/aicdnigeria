           <h4>The main humanitarian challenges in Nigeria</h4>

               <li>Due to the Boko Haram insurgency, the North-East hosts the highest number of
                    persons with disabilities. Only 5% of the Nigerian adults with disability are 
                    literate, while more than 90% of children with disabilities have no access to
                     elementary education.</li>

                     <li>AICD interviewed 70 PWDs in the North-East region about the impact of the conflicts on their
                          lives and the challenges they face generally. 66 among the 70 people that were interviewed 
                          reported their challenge â€“STIGMATIZATION, OUT OF SCHOOL, DISCRIMINATION, NEGLECT, EXCLUSION,
                           LACK OF ACCESS TO AVAILABLE RESOURCES, and DISTURBING EXPERIENCE WHICH RESULT TO DEPRESSION.
